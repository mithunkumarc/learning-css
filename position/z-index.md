z-index : default value is zero/auto  

-1 value can be given to element when u want this element to appear below all elements.  
+1 or more value can be given to element when u want this element to appear above all elements.  


#### The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element.

#### An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.

### Note: z-index only works on positioned elements (position: absolute, position: relative, position: fixed, or position: sticky).

#### prefer zindex on children elements
